## About

- these docs are intented to communicate my project better.
- they are firt divided by the main components: backend, frontend, MCP (AI integration code)
- the intetion is for technical readers to read and understand better my project, and the developer (me)


## Style
- Professional yet Slightly Personal: Use "I" to highlight your contributions and thinking, but maintain a professional and technical focus.
- Clear and Concise: Recruiters are busy. Get to the point, use clear headings, bullet points, and avoid unnecessary jargon.

- Problem-Solving Focused: Emphasize the challenges you overcame and the solutions you implemented. This is key to demonstrating your technical abilities.
